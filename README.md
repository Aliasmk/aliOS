# aliOS
Rudimentary x86 Operating System Project

aliOS will take multiple forms throughout this project. Each version will ideally build up additional functionality and complexity from the previous, starting from a 16-bit real mode Hello World program.

## Current Status:
Can boot img file in Virtual Box as a floppy. Displays "aliOS -- Hello World"

More details soon. Need to finish exams first.
